# my-first-repo
first Experiment with a fastai project
The aim is to understand how to build an actual web app from a trained model. It will accept a jpg file or an URL to a jpg file and give you back the probability of the best match of tree species.

Included are a model file, a .py file using Starlette API and anything else needed to deploy and run from - in this case - Zeit Now.

For AI, i am going to build a classifier of trees, starting of with a few basic tree species. The image I will download from Google images.
